# Installation

This guide covers the installation process for the PilottAI framework.

## Requirements

PilottAI requires the following:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Supported operating systems: Linux, macOS, Windows
- Optional: An API key for your LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

## Installation Methods

### Using pip (Recommended)

The simplest way to install PilottAI is using pip:

```bash
pip install pilott
```

### Installing with Optional Dependencies

PilottAI offers optional dependency sets for various use cases:

```bash
# Install with document processing dependencies
pip install "pilott[docs]"

# Install with development dependencies
pip install "pilott[dev]"

# Install with all dependencies
pip install "pilott[all]"
```

### Installing from Source

To install the latest development version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anuj0456/pilottai.git
cd pilottai
pip install -e .
```

## Verifying Installation

Verify your installation with:

```bash
python -c "import pilott; print(pilott.__version__)"
```

This should display the current version of PilottAI.

## Installing LLM Provider SDKs

PilottAI supports multiple LLM providers. Depending on which provider you choose, you may need to install additional packages:

```bash
# For OpenAI
pip install openai

# For Anthropic
pip install anthropic

# For Google VertexAI
pip install google-cloud-aiplatform
```

## Configuration

After installation, you'll need to configure your LLM provider API keys. There are several ways to do this:

### Environment Variables

Set your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
# For OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# For Anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### Configuration File

You can also create a configuration file `~/.pilottai/config.yaml` with your API keys:

```yaml
llm:
  provider: openai
  api_key: your-api-key
  model_name: gpt-4
```

### Runtime Configuration

Alternatively, you can provide your API key at runtime:

```python
from pilottai import Serve
from pilottai.core import LLMConfig

llm_config = LLMConfig(
    provider="openai",
    api_key="your-api-key",
    model_name="gpt-4"
)

pilott = Serve(llm_config=llm_config)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**ImportError: No module named 'pilott'**

- Make sure you've installed the package correctly
- Check that your Python environment matches the one where you installed the package

**ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openai'**

- Install the required provider SDK: `pip install openai`

**API key error**

- Ensure your API key is correctly set and valid
- Check that you're using the right environment variable name
